This is a complete multi-page recipe website inspired by modern food blogs.
It uses only HTML and CSS and is structured for a student group project.

Folders:

- images/         -> put your own recipe images here

HTML files:
- index.html      -> home page with tagline, intro text, and image strip

To use:
1. Open index.html in your browser.
2. Place image files into the images/ folder.
3. Rename images to match the placeholders (e.g., recipe1.jpg, breakfast1.jpg)
   or change the src attribute in the <img> tags.
4. Replace text with your own recipes if desired.
