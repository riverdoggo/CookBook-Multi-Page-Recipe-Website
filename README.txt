# CookBook – HTML & CSS Recipe Website

CookBook is a multi-page recipe website created as a front-end student project 
using only HTML and CSS. The goal of the project was to design a clean, modern, 
and easy-to-navigate website that mimics the feel of real food blogs.

## Features
- Fully responsive layout  
- Homepage with tagline, image strip, and intro sections  
- Category pages (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Desserts)  
- Recipe cards with time/difficulty labels  
- Contact page with form fields (mock layout)  
- Smooth hover animations and modern UI elements  
- Organised project structure and reusable components  

## Images Disclaimer
The images used in the project are **not owned by me** and are included strictly
as placeholders for educational and demonstration purposes.
Additionally, **not all required images are present in the /images folder**, so
Users should add their own images or replace the placeholder paths as needed.

## Technologies
- HTML5  
- CSS3 (flexbox, grid, animations, responsive design)  

## Project Structure
- `/index.html` – homepage  
- `/recipes.html` – recipe categories  
- `/start-here.html` – beginner tips  
- `/breakfast.html`, `/lunch.html`, `/dinner.html`, `/desserts.html` – recipe sets  
- `/contact.html` – styled contact form

This project demonstrates front-end fundamentals, clean structure, teamwork, 
and attention to UI/UX detail.
