            <h1>About CookBook</h1>
            <p>
                CookBook is a simple recipe website created by students who believe good food shouldn’t be complicated.
                We built this project using only HTML and CSS, inspired by modern food blogs that make cooking feel easy,
                fun, and accessible for everyone.

                <h2>Our Goal</h2>
                <p>
                    Our goal was to design a clean and friendly space where anyone can find meal inspiration — from quick
                    breakfasts to cozy dinners and sweet treats. Every part of this site is intentionally simple so that
                    beginners can follow along and build confidence in the kitchen.

                <p>
                    The recipes you see now are placeholders that you can later replace with your own creations. The structure
                    of the pages is ready for real content, images, and instructions.

                <h2>The Team</h2>
                <p>
                    CookBook was built by a team of four students working together:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Student 1</strong> – Homepage layout and navigation structure.</li>
                    <li><strong>Student 2</strong> – Recipe category pages and sample content.</li>
                    <li><strong>Student 3</strong> – Individual recipe layouts and text.</li>
                    <li><strong>Student 4</strong> – CSS styling, spacing, and responsive design.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    This project allowed us to practice planning, dividing work, and keeping a consistent design system across
                    multiple pages.
